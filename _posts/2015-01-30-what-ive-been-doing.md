> “So, uh, what exactly do you _do_ these days?”

I hear this question and I smile awkwardly, because I’m still not sure how to answer it concisely.

Distant friends and professional acquaintances have admitted, upon reconnecting, that they’ve sort of lost track of me since I [left Simple](/2012/07/25/moving-on.html). I don’t blame them: I’ve been all over the place, geographically and work-wise. It doesn’t help that my periodic hiatuses from Twitter have turned semi-permanent, drying up that steady drip of personal context out to whoever wants it.

I had an enjoyable full-time stint at [DOBT](http://www.dobt.co/) for the first half of 2014. At that point the company decided to sharpen their focus down to a single product, and not one I had much to contribute to.

Prior and since, I’ve been doing a lot. About as much as I ever have, really, just not neatly packaged up with a job title and a company name and a business card. This is what’s been keeping me busy over the past couple years:

### Consulting

I’ve consulted on API design, building developer communities, systems architecture, devops, and language design, amongst other things. My clients have included [Cover](http://www.paywithcover.com/), [Brick Alloy](http://brickalloy.com/), [Orchestrate](https://orchestrate.io/), and a couple of stealth companies.

I recently spent a week on-site at the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/) in DC. They have a great team and an incredibly important mission. Getting to know them was a blast.

My next consulting project is overhauling a web-based piece for a notable contemporary artist.

### Prototyping

Several friends have come to me with product ideas in need of a proof-of-concept implementation. Working with friends can be tricky, especially when everyone’s juggling other commitments, but I’ve had fun building these.

### Teaching

I did two rotations as a resident at [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/) in NYC. I’ll be in Denver at [Turing](http://turing.io/) the first week in March. In a sea of questionable “code schools”, those two are doing it right, to my mind.

### Investing and Advising

I’ve continued to make angel investments in select technology startups. My thesis, such as it is, is a combination of “invest in what you know” and investing for social impact. That’s led to a modest portfolio with concentrations in API-driven products, devops tools, products that facilitate team communication, and health data.

I’ve also made larger-dollar investments outside of tech. Those deals have required learning about unfamiliar and rapidly-evolving industries and markets. I find that kind of research really fun, but it can be a job in and of itself.

### Giving

Without question, the thing I’ve been enjoying the most is giving people time and money; it’s just the best. Giving smartly, though, can be as time-intensive as researching for-profit investments. Plus, as more non-profits leverage technology, there’s at least as much advisory work to be done in that world as there is for startups. I love it.

## Over The Bridge

That’s what I’ve been up to, all while moving, traveling a whole bunch, writing, speaking, [organizing a conference](/2014/09/16/thoughts-on-five-years-of-emerging-languages.html), and dealing with family health matters. That doesn’t answer it all, though.

> “Are you going to do another startup?”

I get this one a lot, too.

As I’ve [written before](/2013/05/23/letter-to-a-young-programmer.html), I don’t believe in startups for the sake of startups. If there’s something I’m really passionate about, and I have the right people with me, _and_ the problem we want to solve is best attacked in the form of a startup, I’d consider it. But I’m not going to jump back into another startup just because that’s what people with my experience are supposed to do.

I like early-stage projects a lot. I’ve found many ways to support them – for-profit and non-profit alike – in full-time roles and otherwise.

> “Workin’ on something big?”

Here’s what I know: I’m happier and healthier than I’ve ever been. I attribute at least some of that to the freedom and flexibility I’ve had over the past couple years. Without creating that stable foundation, I wasn’t ever going to accomplish anything again. Good health, mental and physical, is invaluable. I was [striving for it](/2010/09/07/startup-health.html) years ago, but actually getting there took more: more time, more energy, more experience, and more patience.

I could see myself continuing to enjoy the mishmash of things that have kept me busy. Not being able to tersely explain what I do is really the only downside. Still, I feel like I have another big project in me. Having made a couple of false starts, I’m getting comfortable with taking my time to find that next thing, or to let it find me.

The other morning, a heavy fog spilled over the hills, enshrouding the city totally. As I drove over a bridge, past and future all but disappeared. I could see two car lengths ahead, two car lengths behind. The top of the bridge and the river below were gone, consumed in water vapor. I turned the radio off and enjoyed the car’s low humming reassurance of forward motion. There was nothing else, and it was enough.
