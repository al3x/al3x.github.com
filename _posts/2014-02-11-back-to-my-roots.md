Since my life was [turned upside-down](https://al3x.net/2012/11/11/alone-together-again.html) in mid-2012, I haven’t had a good answer to the question “what do you do?”. I’ve been doing things, of course. I’ve traveled, consulted, advised, invested, and written. I spent a lot of time in museums and a lot of time staring at the ocean. I did things I wanted to do, and I did things I needed to do.

This has been the first time in over a decade that I haven’t had a full-time job for a long stretch. My knee-jerk response to that lack of definition was to jump back into a familiar structure. At the beginning of 2013, I rushed into a role at a startup that turned out not to be the right fit. Since then, I’ve cautiously evaluated the opportunities that have presented themselves.

To make things a little more surreal: a few weeks after I turned 30 this past October, Twitter went public, confirming that I never *need* to work again. (I’m still getting my head around that.)

So, what do you do when you don’t need a job?

I considered a bunch of options. Agonized, even. I thought about going back to school for subjects as diverse as computer science, philosophy, art, political science, economics, and architecture. I thought about writing full time. I was approached by VC firms, and by a number of startups looking for technical leadership. At my most frustrated, I even thought of [pulling a jwz](http://www.salon.com/2000/02/10/zawinski/) and flaming out of tech entirely, maybe to make music or volunteer all the time or who knows what.

None of that felt right.

Finding DOBT
------------

When asked about my background, I usually mention that I grew up in DC and got my professional start there building software for campaigns and non-profits. This was well before the technology-driven victories of the Obama campaign, and even before Howard Dean’s pioneering use of online fundraising.

One of the instrumental figures in the Dean campaign’s use of technology was [Clay Johnson](http://www.informationdiet.com/about), who I first met during Twitter’s breakout year at [SXSW](http://sxsw.com/) 2007. Clay immediately went on my mental list of people I’d like to work with someday. Since then, Clay has led efforts to open public data at the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/), written an [influential book on conscious information consumption](http://www.informationdiet.com/), and has been fighting for procurement reform and innovation as a [Presidential Innovation Fellow](http://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows/teammembers).

Several weeks ago, I found myself sitting on the couch, a little demoralized after exploring yet another job opportunity that didn’t feel right. My [lovely and talented girlfriend](http://nicoleabrodeur.com/) put on an episode of *The Daily Show* in which Jon Stewart was (justifiably) ranting on a recurring topic: the inefficiency of the [VA](https://www.va.gov/). At that moment, my train of thought: “Someone in tech needs to do something about this. I should do something about this. Who do I know who’s probably trying to do something about this? *Clay*.”

I’ve [joined up](http://blog.dobt.co/2014/02/11/welcome-al3x/) with Clay, his talented technical co-founder [Adam](https://github.com/adamjacobbecker), and government relations whiz [Sid](https://twitter.com/sidburgess) at [The Department of Better Technology](http://www.dobt.co/). Simply put, we’re making software that makes government work better.

Now *this* feels right.

Company Values
--------------

DOBT operates by a set of values that have, through experience, become very important to me: allowing and encouraging remote work, operating internally without titles, self-directed time management, and a non-dogmatic approach to building quality software products. I’ve seen enough [business madness](https://al3x.net/2012/02/12/on-business-madness.html), and DOBT eschews it all. We’re working to build something sustainable at both a financial and human level.

Supporting diversity in tech initiatives has been a personal cause, so it was equally important to me that the people I work with understand the necessity of overturning the exclusionary monoculture that so defines our industry today. DOBT is not only a company with a commitment to diversity, but we’re advocating for a streamlining of minority- and woman-owned government contracting set-asides. Those reforms will unlock some five billion dollars for workers who have been economically disadvantaged.

Lastly, what attracted me to DOBT was the idea of working with a group of people who believe in government, and believe that technology can be a force for positive momentum in government. The [HealthCare.gov](http://healthcare.gov/) debacle is just one example of what an uphill battle we have to fight, but it’s unquestionably worth the effort. For all its faults and frustrations, government is a pillar of civilization and deserves a foundation of well-crafted and open technology.

I still believe in technology, I still believe in government, and I still believe in startups. I’m happy to be putting that all together again with my new colleagues at DOBT. I hope you’ll consider [joining us](https://gist.github.com/adamjacobbecker/7105101).
