================

A journalist’s output is journalism. A critic’s output is criticism. A programmer’s output should be programs.

I am a programmer who writes. When I write, particularly when I write critically of technology, I should have programmatic solutions to offer along with my words. If I don’t have code to back up what I have to say, I haven’t thought through the problem at hand thoroughly enough.

There’s no shortage of questions, but answers are scarce.
