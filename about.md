# About the author and this site

I'm Alex Payne. I go by `al3x` online. I've been writing here for many years, much longer than the trimmed-down [archive](https://al3x.net/archive.html) covers.

I'm a [programmer](https://github.com/al3x), writer, and [early-stage investor](https://angel.co/al3xpayne). I primarily work with teams who focus on measurable social and environmental impact, as well as firms who are building infrastructural technology. I also help out with political campaigns and non-profit organizations from time to time.

I was co-founder and CTO of [Simple](https://www.simple.com/), an online bank. Before that I was one of the first employees at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/al3x), where I started their developer platform team. I've written code for campaigns, nonprofits, unions, a defense/intelligence contractor, and a variety of [open source projects](https://github.com/al3x). I coauthored _[Programming Scala](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033073.do)_ (O'Reilly, 2009), started the [Emerging Languages](https://al3x.net/2014/09/16/thoughts-on-five-years-of-emerging-languages.html) conference, presented at [events](/events.html) around the world, and have taught at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) and [Turing School](http://turing.io/). I was a founding board member of [Business For A Better Portland](https://www.bbpdx.org/).

I live in Oregon with my wife, [Nicole Brodeur](http://nicoleabrodeur.com), two cats, an anxious pit bull, and a rotating cast of foster dogs.
