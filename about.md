<h2 class="intro">About the author and this site.</h2>

I'm Alex Payne. I go by `al3x` online. I've been writing here for many years, much longer than the trimmed-down [archive](https://al3x.net/archive.html) covers.

I currently spend most of my time supporting organizations and campaigns that I care about. I serve as chair of the national [Tech Committee](http://www.dsausa.org/tech_committee) for the [Democratic Socialists of America](http://www.dsausa.org/) and am a founding board member of [Business For A Better Portland](https://www.bbpdx.org/).

I was cofounder and CTO of [Simple](https://www.simple.com/), an online bank. Before that I was one of the first employees at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), where I started their developer platform team. I've written code for campaigns, nonprofits, unions, a defense/intelligence contractor, and a variety of [open source projects](https://github.com/al3x). I coauthored _[Programming Scala](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033073.do)_ (O'Reilly, 2009), started the [Emerging Languages](https://al3x.net/2014/09/16/thoughts-on-five-years-of-emerging-languages.html) conference, presented at [events](/events.html) around the world, and have taught at [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) and [Turing School](http://turing.io/). I'm also an [investor](https://angel.co/al3xpayne) in a number of businesses, primarily companies delivering measurable social and environmental impact and/or building infrastructural technology.

I live in Portland, Oregon with my wife, [Nicole Brodeur](http://nicoleabrodeur.com), two cats, an anxious pitbull, and a rotating cast of foster dogs. I like [playing records for people](https://soundcloud.com/a-l-e-x-payne) and spending time in the beautiful State of Oregon.
